# XIVSnapper

### A forked and maintained mod originally based on work by @eqbot, and previously managed by @ViviAshe. 
(Since there hasn't been much activity from ViviAshe lately, I’ve taken it upon myself to keep it going. Call me the de facto maintainer.)

### What is it?
XIVSnapper is a plugin that saves and loads your character's current appearance—including all applied mods. It's made for those who want to export their character *exactly as-is* into a single-character mod collection. Perfect for sharing mod setups with friends without relying on MCDF. Your friends can take your snapshot and make their own adjustments, no restrictions.

### Where to get it:
Add this custom repo to Dalamud (check their documentation if you’re unfamiliar with that process):

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brendoncintas/plugins/main/Plugins.json`

### How to use it:
1. **Set a working directory** in the settings menu.
2. **To save snapshots**: Do it *outside* of GPose for best results.
3. **To load snapshots**:
   - Enter GPose.
   - Select an actor.
   - Use the Load button to pick a snapshot folder.
   - Best performance comes from using [Brio](https://github.com/AsgardXIV/Brio)-spawned actors. I test against those, and if you load onto anything else, you're on your own. Fixes for that won’t be a priority.

### Disclaimer:
Don't use this mod for creepy, inappropriate, or goonish things. This tool exists for character customization and mod sharing, so for the love of all that is good in this world, use it like a reasonable adult.
