# XIVSnapper

### A forked and maintained mod originally based on work by @eqbot, and previously managed by @ViviAshe. 
(Since there hasn't been much activity from ViviAshe lately, I’ve taken it upon myself to keep it going. Call me the de facto maintainer.)

### What is it?
XIVSnapper is a plugin that saves and loads your character's current appearance—including all applied mods. It's made for those who want to export their character *exactly as-is* into a single-character mod collection. Perfect for sharing mod setups with friends without relying on MCDF. Your friends can take your snapshot and make their own adjustments, no restrictions.

### Where to get it:
Add this custom repo to Dalamud (check their documentation if you’re unfamiliar with that process):

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brendoncintas/plugins/main/Plugins.json`

### How to use it:
1. **Set a working directory** in the settings menu.
2. **To save snapshots**: Do it *outside* of GPose for best results.
3. **To load snapshots**:
   - Enter GPose.
   - Select an actor.
   - Use the Load button to pick a snapshot folder.
   - Best performance comes from using [Brio](https://github.com/AsgardXIV/Brio)-spawned actors. I test against those, and if you load onto anything else, you're on your own. Fixes for that won’t be a priority.

### Disclaimer:
If you use this mod, use it in good faith. Don’t use this for creepy, inappropriate, or goonish nonsense. This tool was built for character customization and mod sharing. Nothing more, nothing less. It’s here to make it easier to preserve, export, and share the way a character looks, especially among friends or within a private modding circle. That’s it.

For the love of all that’s decent, use it like a reasonable adult. If your first instinct is to twist this tool into something it was never meant for, you’re part of the problem. Don’t be that person. Just because the technology allows something doesn’t mean you should do it.

If you’re upset by the existence of this mod, please understand this: it’s being maintained with honest, constructive intentions. Its purpose is utility, not exploitation. It’s about preserving creativity and not crossing lines. Yes, I maintain this project, but no, I’m not responsible for how individuals choose to use it. I can’t control what people do once it’s in their hands, and I won’t pretend to. What I can do is make the tool accessible, useful, and transparent about what it’s meant for. Beyond that, the responsibility lies with the user.
